In this project named "Rock, Paper, Scissors", I used my fundamental knowledge that I've gained to create a game of the same name using only Javascript. I used my knowledge of functions, if/else statements, loops, and other concepts to play a 5 rounds of rock paper scissors and declare a winner. Unfortunately at this time, you can only make a single choice of rock, paper, or scissors thatll apply to the whole game but as I learn more I will continue to update this game so that it'll become more interactive until it is its own full site.

06/10/2020: Updated project with an interractive webpage and css. I adjusted the scripts so it is interractive with the webpage and is a fully playable game. While I am not necessarily content with the styling of the page and still have a few features i want to add (such as the ability for the user to add a user name) I am content with the webpage being usable and look forward to even further improving it in the future.
